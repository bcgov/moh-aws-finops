# 📘 FinOps & Power BI Integration
## Optimizing AWS Cost Visibility with Power BI

---

## 🔹 Overview
This project integrates **AWS FinOps** (Financial Operations) with **Power BI** to provide a centralized and visualized view of **AWS cost and usage** across multiple accounts. It automates the process of aggregating AWS Cost and Usage Reports (CUR) and makes them available for Power BI analysis.

---

## 🔹 Project Goals
- **Automate AWS cost data ingestion** from multiple accounts into a structured S3 storage system.
- **Aggregate cost data** across accounts for analysis in Power BI.
- **Enable scheduled updates** to keep Power BI reports current.
- **Provide actionable insights** for optimizing AWS costs and usage.

## 🔹 Architecture
### 📂 S3 Bucket Structure

| **Bucket Name**        | **Purpose**                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `finops-working`       | Stores raw cost reports from multiple AWS accounts.   |
| `finops-processed`     | Aggregated and cleaned data ready for Power BI ingestion. |
| `finops-archive`       | Historical versions of processed reports for audit and rollback. |

### 🔗 Data Flow
1. **AWS Cost & Usage Report (CUR)** is generated daily.
2. **AWS Lambda** fetches the CUR data and saves it in `finops-working`.
3. **Lambda processes and aggregates** the data into `finops-processed` for Power BI.
4. **Power BI refreshes daily** by pulling from `finops-processed`.
5. **Archived reports** are moved to `finops-archive` for historical tracking.

## 🔹 Technology Stack
### **AWS Services**
- **S3** (Storage of cost reports)
- **AWS Lambda** (Automation of data processing)
- **Cost Explorer API** (Fetching AWS cost and usage data)

### **Power BI**
- **Scheduled refreshes** to ingest AWS cost data
- **Dashboards for FinOps analysis**

### **GitHub & CI/CD**
- Source control for Lambda scripts and automation workflows

---

## 🔹 Setup & Usage
### 1️⃣ Deploy AWS Lambda for Data Processing
```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB/FinOps-PowerBI.git
cd FinOps-PowerBI
```
- Deploy Lambda using AWS CLI or AWS Console.

### 2️⃣ Configure S3 Buckets
- Ensure the correct bucket names in the Lambda configuration.

### 3️⃣ Connect Power BI to S3 Data
- Load processed cost data from `finops-processed`.
- Configure **scheduled refresh** in Power BI.

## 🔹 Roadmap & Next Steps
✅ Initial setup with AWS Lambda, S3, and Power BI.  
🚀 Enhance Power BI dashboards with trend analysis.  
📊 Implement forecasting and anomaly detection for cost optimization.
